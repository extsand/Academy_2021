# Part1
# 1. How many states could has a process in Linux?


# 2. Examine the pstree command. Make output (highlight) the chain (ancestors) of the current
# process.
# 3. What is a proc file system?
# 4. Print information about the processor (its type, supported technologies, etc.).
# 5. Use the ps command to get information about the process. The information should be as
# follows: the owner of the process, the arguments with which the process was launched for
# execution, the group owner of this process, etc.
# 6. How to define kernel processes and user processes?
# 7. Print the list of processes to the terminal. Briefly describe the statuses of the processes.
# What condition are they in, or can they be arriving in?
# 8. Display only the processes of a specific user.
# 9. What utilities can be used to analyze existing running tasks (by analyzing the help for the ps
# command)?
# 10. What information does top command display?
# 12. Display the processes of the specific user using the top command.
# 12. What interactive commands can be used to control the top command? Give a couple of

# 13. Sort the contents of the processes window using various parameters (for example, the
# amount of processor time taken up, etc.)
# 14. Concept of priority, what commands are used to set priority?
# 15. Can I change the priority of a process using the top command? If so, how?
# 16. Examine the kill command. How to send with the kill command

# Part2
# 1. Check the implementability of the most frequently used OPENSSH commands in the MS

# screenshots: command â€“ result should be presented)
# 2. Implement basic SSH settings to increase the security of the client-server connection (at least
# 3. List the options for choosing keys for encryption in SSH. Implement 3 of them.
# 4. Implement port forwarding for the SSH client from the host machine to the guest Linux
# virtual machine behind NAT.
# 5*. Intercept (capture) traffic (tcpdump, wireshark) while authorizing the remote client on the
# server using ssh, telnet, rlogin. Analyze the result.
